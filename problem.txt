At first we loop through the given years, then we check if the year is a leap year,we select the months array accordingly, since 1st of janauary is monday so I set the day to 2, then we loop through each array of months, check the remainder, if the remainder is 1 than we increase the value of count else we change the value of day to the remainder which refers to the current day. remainder 0 refers to saturday as the next month 1st date.
